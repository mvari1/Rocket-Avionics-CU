# Rocket Club Sensor Integration Project

## Introduction

This repository is part of the Rocket Club's sub-team project focused on integrating the multiple sensors with the STM32L412KB microcontroller. The goal of this project is to gather accurate sensor data that will be used for the successful launch and operation of an L1 rocket.

## Sensor Information

- Sensors: LIS3MDL Magnetometer, MPL3115A2 Altimeter
- Microcontroller: STM32L412KB

## Project Overview

### LIS3MDL Driver

This repository contains the driver and related code for the LIS3MDL sensor. The driver allows the microcontroller to interface with the sensor, read magnetometer data, and configure its settings.

### MPL3115A2 Driver

This repository contains the driver and related code for the MPL3115A2 sensor. The driver allows the microcontroller to interface with the sensor, read altimeter data, and configure its settings.

### Usage

- To utilize the LIS3MDL and MPL3115A2 driver, refer to the code within this repository. The driver has been tailored to work with the STM32L412KB microcontroller.
- Ensure that the sensor is properly connected to the microcontroller as per the hardware setup.
